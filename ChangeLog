ReSrc4 v2.1 ( 18-Oct-2023 )

- Rewrote the code, so it portable and works on little endian machines.

- First release of source code under GPL v3.


ReSrc4 v2.2 ( 20-Oct-2023 )

- If a jmp/jsr tries to jump outside Hunk file Memory area, a warning will
 be printed.. Instead of triggering an error during Trace.

- Removed unistd.h include file and the single access() function.. Now it
 should be fully standard c library.

- Makefile will default to Linux envirement compile.


ReSrc4 v2.3 ( 29-Oct-2023 )

- Added support for many FPU opcodes and a few more Integer opcodes.

- Added support for many standard library calls.

- Fixed a tracing error where registers was not cleared after jsr/bsr calls.

- I had a test file where 3 labels had the same name but in diffrent
  objects/section. So now there are a label check for names collision.

- Rewrote the Jump Table detector.


ReSrc4 v2.4 ( 04-Feb-2024 )

- Fixed SegFaults in Hash Lookup functions. Changed them to work as unsigned
  integers, as negative values would result in a crash.


ReSrc4 v2.5 ( 12-Feb-2024 )

- Added support for Addx, Subx and Negx.

- Added support for 020 Addressing modes. It uses vasm syntax.

- Fixed: A BSS entry could be marks as String data. That would 
  result in a change from ds.b to dc.b, but not any more.

- Added: support for FMove to handle fpiar/fpsr/fpcr regs.

- Fixed: FNeg had the correct bit mask but called the wrong
  function. So it became a FSub instead.

- Added: 3 new jump tables and fixed one with a Mask error.


ReSrc4 v2.6 ( 21-Feb-2024 )

- Added support for Andi to SR/CCR regs.

- Added support for Eori to SR/CCR regs.

- Added support for Ori to SR/CCR regs.

- Added support for Move to/from SR/CCR/USP regs.

- Added support for Tas opcode.

- Added support for Trapcc opcodes.

- Added support for Moves opcode.

- Added support for Move16 opcode.


ReSrc4 v2.7 ( 25-Feb-2024 )

- Added support for Stop opcode.

- Added support for LPStop opcode.

- Added support for FNop opcode.

- Added support for FSave opcode.

- Added support for FRestore opcode.


ReSrc4 v2.8 ( 29-Jul-2024 )

- Updated Hunk File parser. It can now handle strcutures where you get
  two or more HUNK_END in a row.

- Added a simply filename check at startup, so Input and Output filename
  are not the same, to avoid overwriting.. but its only a simply strcmp().

- Changed Makefile so it no longer creates a .map file on compile.


ReSrc4 v2.9 ( 16-Nov-2024 )

- Changed String Labels now start with 'Str_'.

- Added: two new command options, --yes and --no to auto anser if you want
  too create a new config file.


ReSrc4 v2.10 ( 15-Jan-2025 )

- Started to reorganise the dir structure. Split the source into subdirs, 
  the plan is support diffrent M68k Platforms in the future.

  This turned out to be a huge task, as splitting the hunk/m68k/aos3 code,
  was very much linked into each other.. this is still ongoing.

- More or less all functions have been refactored to return error codes.
  This was also a huge task but should be finsihed, only more specific
  error code have to be defined. Right now most only return Okay or Error.

- Internal passer have been changed to work with a 64bit values instead
  of 32bit too help support newer cpus. 

- Implemented HUNK_RELRELOC32 (3FD).

- Fixed Bra.l that could jump between sections.

- Added a Verbose switch too print more info on whats going on. 
  --verbose or -v/-v1 for extra info.. --verbose2 or -v2 even more info.

- The type parameter for Label have been expanded too some support 
   Amiga structures.

  Currently those have been definded.

  - String        : Global : NUL Terminated String.
  - Lib_Asl       : AmigaOS3 : Asl Base Pointer.
  - Lib_Diskfont  : AmigaOS3 : Diskfont Base Pointer.
  - Lib_Dos       : AmigaOS3 : DOS Base Pointer.
  - Lib_Exec      : AmigaOS3 : Exec Base Pointer.
  - Lib_Gfx       : AmigaOS3 : Graphics Base Pointer.
  - Lib_IFFParse  : AmigaOS3 : IFFParse Base Pointer.
  - Lib_Intuition : AmigaOS3 : Intuition Base Pointer.
  - Lib_Layers    : AmigaOS3 : Layers Base Pointer.
  - Lib_Mathffp   : AmigaOS3 : Mathffp Base Pointer.
  - Lib_Mathtrans : AmigaOS3 : Mathtrans Base Pointer.
  - Lib_Utility   : AmigaOS3 : Utility Base Pointer.
  - Str_BitMap    : AmigaOS3 : BitMap structure.
  - Str_Gadget    : AmigaOS3 : Gadget structure.
  - Str_IntuiText : AmigaOS3 : IntuiText structure.
  - Str_LWGadData : AmigaOS3 : Lightwave Gadget Structure.
  - Str_NewScreen : AmigaOS3 : NewScreen structure.
  - Str_RastPort  : AmigaOS3 : RastPort structure.
  - Str_Rectangle : AmigaOS3 : Rectangle structure.
  - Str_TextAttr  : AmigaOS3 : TextAttr structure.

  Example:

  ; Create a label at $00135e98, without setting a name.
  ; a name will be automaticly generated.
  ; Type is set IntuiText. The type parm is optional.
  LabelName: $00135e98 "", Type: Str_IntuiText

  L0100:  dc.b  $ff        ; it_FrontPen
          dc.b  $ff        ; it_BackPen
          dc.b  $00        ; it_DrawMode
          dc.b  $00        ; it_KludgeFill00
          dc.w  $0004      ; it_LeftEdge
          dc.w  $0004      ; it_TopEdge
          dc.l  $00000000  ; it_ITextFont
          dc.l  Str_0200   ; it_IText
          dc.l  L0101      ; it_NextText

  If it_IText is set, Label is marked as a String
  and if the it_NextText points to next gadget, it will mark decode
  that as another IntuiText structure and so on.

- Scanning for M68k Jump tables have been updated.

  I had to clone most of the entries as there are
  two way to do an integer compare.

  Cmp.l   #$00000013,D0  ; b0bc 0000 0013
  Cmpi.l  #$00000013,D0  ; 0c80 0000 0013

  Those two opcode does exactly the same.


ReSrc4 v2.11 ( 16-Jan-2025 )

- Fixed label names that would not be shown in release mode.

- Fixed printing 64bit values on 32bit systems. Problem was eg. %ld or %lx
  worked on 64bit system, but on 32bit it was expected %lld and %llx.
  So now you can see lx / ld is changed to PRIx64 / PRId64 in the source.

- Fixed a lot of white spaces in the M68k Opcode table.


ReSrc4 v2.12 ( 17-Jan-2025 )

- Bumped copyright year to 2025

- Fixed a label bug.. that only show up when I disabled DEBUG :(
  If you had a label outside of the memory area, it would not be generated
  correctly.. ie. Sec_0001-12 would be converted to ($12345678).l and
  you would loose a Reloc when assembled again.


ReSrc4 v2.13 ( 10-Apr-2025 )

- Changed code for parsing of Options.

- Changed the output level.. you can control it with options 
  -v0 = Off (only errors)
  -v1 = Minimum (default)
  -v2 = extra info (hunk)
  -v3 = even more
  -v4 = alot


ReSrc4 v2.14 ( 28-Sep-2025 )

- Changed source types too U8/U16/U32/U64 and so on.

- Updated Makefile too put .o and .d files into its own subdir.

- Parser now try and identify the Label access size. It will add
  i08_/i16_/i32_/i64_/f32_/f64 too label name if it can detect size.
 

ReSrc4 v2.15 ( 04-Oct-2025 )

- Added support for MsgPort and TextFont structures.

- Changed ds.w/ds.l to use dc.b as its easyer to read.

- Improved Tracing.. handling of putting Library bases into labels
  and retriving them again.. works alot better now.

- Improved extended library function support.. ie OpenResource was
  not converted too my new library scanning. This one and others
  have now better handling.

- Added support for Movec opcode.

- Changed file header, still gpl v3 but added "SPDX-License-Identifier"


ReSrc4 v2.16 ( 13-Dec-2025 )

- Added support for FHR file (Container), still a m68k file.
  Its still in beta, so there are proberly some hidden bugs.
